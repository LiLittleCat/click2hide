## ✨ New Features in this Fork

- **Minimize Support**: Added option to minimize windows instead of just hiding them.
- **Configurable Action**: Choose between "Hide" or "Minimize" mode in the settings.
- **Improved Restore**: Clicking the Dock icon again reliably restores the application window.

## Overview

No more hunting for hidden windows on your Mac. **Click2Hide** automatically hide/un-minimizes apps when you click on the app icon on dock, saving you precious time and frustration whether you're deep in a presentation, juggling multiple projects, or simply desire a cleaner workspace.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of Click2Hide.dmg from the [Releases](https://github.com/victorwon/click2hide/releases) page.
2. Open the dmg file, drag and drop the Click2Hide.app to the Applications folder.
3. You may now open the Click2Hide.app from the Applications folder and follow the steps to bypass the gatekeeper on MacOS Sequoia. This is a one-time procedure for MacOS Sequoia only. Additionally, this is an open-source application. Therefore, in the event of any security concerns, you may verify the code to ease your mind.
